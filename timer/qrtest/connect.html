        option 1 - use a phone with a camera to associate two devices via QR Codes
      </h1>
      <p>
        for this to work, you need to have physical access to both devices, and a mobile phone with a camera.
      </p>
      <p>
        once asscicated, the phone is no longer needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        scan this  QR code, then the other screen's QR code, and the phone will send both random codes
        to the server, where they will be informed of each other. the devices then negotiate a webrtc connection
        which means they talk directly to each other.

        option 2 - send a url from one device to the other (via email or some other method)        
      </h1>
      <p>
        for this to work, both devices need internet access, the devices will negotiate a webrtc connection
        which means they talk directly to each other.
        click <button id="shareBtn">here</button> to copy the url to share with the other browser.
